NAME
       all-swaps  -  event signalling that all swap partitions have been acti‚Äê
       vated

SYNOPSIS
       all-swaps [ENV]...

DESCRIPTION
       The all-swaps event is generated by the mountall(8) daemon after it has
       activated  all  swap  partitions listed in fstab(5).  mountall(8) emits
       this event as an informational signal, services and  tasks  started  or
       stopped by this event will do so in parallel with other activity.

       When  this  event  occurs,  common  filesystems such as /usr may not be
       mounted.

EXAMPLE
       A service that wishes to be running once swap partitions are  activated
       might use:

              start on all-swaps
