NAME
       Algorithm::Diff::XS - Algorithm::Diff with XS core loop

SYNOPSIS
           # Drop-in replacement to Algorithm::Diff, but "compact_diff"
           # and C<LCSidx> will run much faster for large data sets.
           use Algorithm::Diff::XS qw( compact_diff LCSidx );

DESCRIPTION
       This module is a simple re-packaging of Joe Schaefer's excellent but
       not very well-known Algorithm::LCS with a drop-in interface that simply
       re-uses the installed version of the Algorithm::Diff module.

       Note that only the "LCSidx" function is optimized in XS at the moment,
       which means only "compact_diff" will get significantly faster for large
       data sets, while "diff" and "sdiff" will run in identical speed as
       "Algorithm::Diff".

BENCHMARK
                             Rate     Algorithm::Diff Algorithm::Diff::XS
       Algorithm::Diff     14.7/s                  --                -98%
       Algorithm::Diff::XS  806/s               5402%                  --

       The benchmarking script is as below:

           my @data = ([qw/a b d/ x 50], [qw/b a d c/ x 50]);
           cmpthese( 500, {
               'Algorithm::Diff' => sub {
                   Algorithm::Diff::compact_diff(@data)
               },
               'Algorithm::Diff::XS' => sub {
                   Algorithm::Diff::XS::compact_diff(@data)
               },
           });
