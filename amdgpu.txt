DESCRIPTION
       amdgpu is an Xorg driver for AMD RADEON-based video cards with the fol‐
       lowing features:

       · Support for 24-bit pixel depth;
       · RandR support up to version 1.4;
       · 3D acceleration;

SUPPORTED HARDWARE
       The amdgpu driver supports CI and newer families' video cards.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
       Please refer to xorg.conf(5) for general configuration  details.   This
       section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.

       The following driver Options are supported:

       Option "SWcursor" "boolean"
              Selects software cursor.  The default is off.

       Option "Accel" "boolean"
              Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.
              The default is on.

       Option "ZaphodHeads" "string"
              Specify  the  RandR output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a par‐
              ticular driver instance.  If you use this option  you  must  use
              this option for all instances of the driver.
              For  example:  Option  "ZaphodHeads"  "LVDS,VGA-0"  will  assign
              xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.

       Option "DRI" "integer"
              Define the maximum level of DRI to enable. Valid  values  are  2
              for DRI2 or 3 for DRI3.  The default is 2 for DRI2.

       Option "EnablePageFlip" "boolean"
              Enable DRI2 page flipping.  The default is on.

       Option "TearFree" "boolean"
              Enable tearing prevention using the hardware page flipping mech‐
              anism. This option currently doesn't have any effect  for  CRTCs
              using  transforms other than rotation or reflection. It requires
              allocating two separate scanout buffers for each supported CRTC.
              Enabling this option currently disables Option "EnablePageFlip".
              The default is off.

       Option "AccelMethod" "string"
              Setting this option to none disables use of the glamor accelera‐
              tion architecture. In that case, all 2D rendering is done by the
              CPU, but 3D and video hardware acceleration can still work. This
              is mainly useful for OpenGL driver bring-up.
              The default is to use glamor.

       The following driver Option is supported for glamor :

       Option "ShadowPrimary" "boolean"
              This option enables a so-called "shadow primary" buffer for fast
              CPU access to pixel data, and separate scanout buffers for  each
              display  controller  (CRTC).   This  may improve performance for
              some 2D workloads, potentially at the expense of other (e.g. 3D,
              video)  workloads.  Note in particular that enabling this option
              currently disables page flipping.  The default is off.
