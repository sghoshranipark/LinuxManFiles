NAME
       /etc/adduser.conf - configuration file for adduser(8) and addgroup(8).

DESCRIPTION
       The   file   /etc/adduser.conf   contains  defaults  for  the  programs
       adduser(8) , addgroup(8) , deluser(8) and delgroup(8).  Each line holds
       a  single  value  pair  in  the  form option = value.  Double or single
       quotes are allowed around the value, as is whitespace around the equals
       sign.  Comment lines must have a hash sign (#) in the first column.

       The valid configuration options are:

       DSHELL The  login  shell  to  be  used  for all new users.  Defaults to
              /bin/bash.

       DHOME  The directory in which new home directories should  be  created.
              Defaults to /home.

       GROUPHOMES
              If  this  is set to yes, the home directories will be created as
              /home/[groupname]/user.  Defaults to no.

       LETTERHOMES
              If this is set to yes, then the home  directories  created  will
              have  an  extra  directory inserted which is the first letter of
              the loginname.  For example: /home/u/user.  Defaults to no.

       SKEL   The directory  from  which  skeletal  user  configuration  files
              should be copied.  Defaults to /etc/skel.

       FIRST_SYSTEM_UID and LAST_SYSTEM_UID
              specify an inclusive range of UIDs from which system UIDs can be
              dynamically allocated. Default to 100 - 999.  Please  note  that
              system  software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd
              package, may assume that UIDs less than 100 are unallocated.

       FIRST_UID and LAST_UID
              specify an inclusive range of UIDs from which normal user's UIDs
              can be dynamically allocated. Default to 1000 - 29999.

       FIRST_SYSTEM_GID and LAST_SYSTEM_GID
              specify an inclusive range of GIDs from which system GIDs can be
              dynamically allocated.  Default to 100 - 999.

       FIRST_GID and LAST_GID
              specify an inclusive range of GIDs  from  which  normal  group's
              GIDs can be dynamically allocated. Default to 1000 - 29999.

       USERGROUPS
              If  this  is  set  to  yes, then each created user will be given
              their own group to use.  If this is no, then each  created  user
              will  be placed in the group whose GID is USERS_GID (see below).
              The default is yes.

       USERS_GID
              If USERGROUPS is no, then USERS_GID is  the  GID  given  to  all
              newly-created users.  The default value is 100.

       DIR_MODE
              If  set to a valid value (e.g. 0755 or 755), directories created
              will have the specified permissions as umask. Otherwise 0755  is
              used as default.

       SETGID_HOME
              If  this  is  set  to  yes, then home directories for users with
              their own group ( USERGROUPS=yes ) will have the setgid bit set.
              This  was  the  default  setting  for  adduser versions << 3.13.
              Unfortunately it has some bad side effects, so we no  longer  do
              this  per  default.  If  you  want it nevertheless you can still
              activate it here.

       QUOTAUSER
              If set to a nonempty value, new users will  have  quotas  copied
              from that user.  The default is empty.

       NAME_REGEX
              User  and  group  names are checked against this regular expres‐
              sion. If the name doesn't match this regexp, user and group cre‐
              ation  in adduser is refused unless --force-badname is set. With
              --force-badname set, only weak checks are performed. The default
              is  the  most  conservative ^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$.  When --system is
              specified, NAME_REGEX_SYSTEM is used instead.

       NAME_REGEX_SYSTEM
              Names of system users are checked against this  regular  expres‐
              sion.   If  --system is supplied and the name doesn't match this
              regexp, user creation in adduser is refused unless  --force-bad‐
              name is set. With --force-badname set, only weak checks are per‐
              formed. The default is as for the default  NAME_REGEX  but  also
              allowing uppercase letters.

       SKEL_IGNORE_REGEX
              Files  in  /etc/skel/  are  checked  against this regex, and not
              copied to the newly created home directory if they match.   This
              is  by default set to the regular expression matching files left
              over from unmerged config files (dpkg-(old|new|dist)).

       ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS
              Setting this to something other than 0 (the default) will  cause
              adduser  to  add  newly  created non-system users to the list of
              groups defined by EXTRA_GROUPS (below).

       EXTRA_GROUPS
              This is the list of groups that new  non-system  users  will  be
              added  to.  By default, this list is 'dialout cdrom floppy audio
              video plugdev users games'

NOTES
       VALID NAMES
              adduser and addgroup enforce conformity to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
              which  allows  only  the following characters to appear in group
              and user names: letters, digits, underscores, periods, at  signs
              (@)  and dashes. The name may no start with a dash. The "$" sign
              is allowed at the end of usernames (to conform to samba).

              An additional check can be adjusted via the configuration param‐
              eter NAME_REGEX to enforce a local policy.
