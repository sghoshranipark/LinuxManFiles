ADDSEVERITY(3)             Linux Programmer's Manual            ADDSEVERITY(3)

NAME
       addseverity - introduce new severity classes

SYNOPSIS
       #include <fmtmsg.h>

       int addseverity(int severity, const char *s);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       addseverity(): _SVID_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       This function allows the introduction of new severity classes which can
       be addressed by the severity argument of the  fmtmsg(3)  function.   By
       default,  that  function  knows only how to print messages for severity
       0-4 (with strings (none),  HALT,  ERROR,  WARNING,  INFO).   This  call
       attaches the given string s to the given value severity.  If s is NULL,
       the severity class with the numeric value severity is removed.   It  is
       not  possible  to  overwrite  or  remove  one  of  the default severity
       classes.  The severity value must be nonnegative.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon success, the value MM_OK is  returned.   Upon  error,  the  return
       value  is MM_NOTOK.  Possible errors include: out of memory, attempt to
       remove a nonexistent or default severity class.

VERSIONS
       addseverity() is provided in glibc since version 2.1.
